3D C++ OpenGL game

Working 3D engine with collision detection, object/texture loader and player controls.
In this game you are swimming through an aquarium trying to not get hit by any bubbles.
Your objective is to swim across to the other side of the aquarium. Bubbles are generating randomly
on the floor of the aquarium, some are slow, some are fast. If you manage to touch the target wall 
next level will be generated with slightly more bubbles, each slightly faster!

To generate bubbles without completely lagging your pc I've used instancing to make things faster.
